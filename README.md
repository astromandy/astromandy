üëã Hi there! I'm **Mandy**, a PhD student in **Astrophysics** with a strong passion for **data science** and **machine learning**. My research focuses on **cataclysmic variable stars**, but I leverage my expertise in **data analysis** to solve a wide range of problems, both in astronomy and in data science.

üî≠ **Research & Data Science Interests**:
- Data-driven insights in **Astrophysics** (cataclysmic variables)
- **Time-series analysis** and **spectroscopy**
- **Predictive modeling** and **machine learning** for scientific discovery
- Large-scale **astronomical data analysis**
- Automation of data collection and analysis workflows

üß† **Skills**:
- **Programming**: Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras)
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised & unsupervised learning, time-series forecasting, model evaluation
- **Data Science**: Feature engineering, statistical analysis, data wrangling
- **Automation**: Scripting, data pipelines, web scraping with **Selenium**
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, data storytelling

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Technologies**:
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, astropy
- Data Science tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Docker, Git/GitHub
- Big Data frameworks: Experience with SQL, cloud-based storage, and processing
- **Astronomy-specific**: pyasassn for ASAS-SN light curves, astronomical data processing pipelines

üåå **My Goal**: To apply **machine learning** and **data science** techniques to **big data** problems, particularly in the field of astronomy. I am eager to transition into industry roles, bringing my research-driven problem-solving approach to impactful, data-centric challenges.

üí¨ **Let's Connect!** I'm always open to discussions on data science, machine learning applications, and astronomy. If you're looking for someone passionate about **data analysis** and **machine learning**, or if you are working on similar projects, feel free to reach out. I am also open to job opportunities in **data science** and **machine learning**.

Looking forward to collaborating and learning from the data science community!
