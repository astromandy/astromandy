-👋 Hi there! I'm Mandy.
I'm currently a PhD student in Astrophysics, focused on the characterization of cataclysmic variable stars. 
I combine observational data analysis with machine learning techniques to better understand these fascinating systems.

🔭 Research interests: cataclysmic variables, time-series analysis, spectroscopy, data science

🧠 Skills: Python, data science, machine learning, automation, time-series, astronomical data

🛠️ Tools: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, selenium, matplotlib, astropy, pyasassn

🌌 I enjoy building tools to explore and process large-scale astronomical datasets efficiently.

💬 Feel free to connect or reach out if you're working on similar projects or just curious about my research!
